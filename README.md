## 🧠 Why This Project?

Most ML trading projects optimize **accuracy**.
This project optimizes **risk-adjusted returns**.

Key principles:

* Prediction ≠ Strategy
* Accuracy ≠ Profitability
* Risk management is essential
* Walk-forward validation over static backtests

## 📈 Sample Results (TSLA)

| Metric       | Value        |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Accuracy     | ~0.48        |
| Sharpe Ratio | ~0.7 – 1.1   |
| Max Drawdown | ~30%         |
| Validation   | Walk-Forward |

> Even with sub-50% accuracy, the strategy achieves positive risk-adjusted returns through selective trading and strict risk control.
